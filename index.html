      <p>Going from elementary school to high school may seem like a daunting task -- but never fear -- they are actually way more similar than you might think.</p>
      <p>If you are going into high school this year, you may be wondering, "what do I need to know to get by?". In this article, we will explain some concepts you should be aware of for the new school year.</p>

      <p>One of the main things you will be suprised about in high school is lack of recess. However, you don't have to worry about being overworked, either. The removal of recess is amended by an almost hour long lunch.</p>

      <p>A LOT of people reading this are probably afraid the work may be too hard, or that they will fail and flunk out.</p>
      <p>While it is true that the work is a little bit more advanced, if you apply the skills you learned in elementary school, your marks will stay similar.</p>

      <p>Honestly, there is no need to stress when transitioning to high school, as long as you are prepared, that is.</p>
      <p>If you apply your skills and prior knowledge, you will pass, and if you are ready for small schedule changes, then there is not much more you need to EXCEL in high school.</p>
